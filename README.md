# Rulla Hatt Seltzer

This website is dedicated to the new alcoholic beverage company specializing in low-calorie refreshing seltzers: Rulla Hatt!

The purpose of this website is to give some insight into the company itself, as well as to entice future customers to purchase our seltzers.


## Bugs

Bug #1: IDs #footer-icon and #footer-icon-text were previously in the same class named .footer-icon, which made me unable to properly align them to eachother in the bottom right corner of the screen. I fixed this by giving them separate IDs instead!

Bug #2: Issues with scaling the #logo and #hat IDs, causing them to be very large on mobile screens. Fixed by changing from % to vw.
