## Bugs

Bug #1: IDs #footer-icon and #footer-icon-text were previously in the same class named .footer-icon, which made me unable to properly align them to eachother in the bottom right corner of the screen. I fixed this by giving them separate IDs instead!

Bug #2: Issues with scaling the #logo and #hat IDs, causing them to be very large on mobile screens. Fixed by changing from % to vw.

Bug #3: Hat icon and text in lower right of screen was not aligning correctly with eachother. Corrected this by making them list items instead.
